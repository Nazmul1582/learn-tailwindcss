      Bangladesh, to the east of India on the Bay of Bengal, is a South Asian
      country marked by lush greenery and many waterways. Its Padma (Ganges),
      Meghna and Jamuna rivers create fertile plains, and travel by boat is
      common. On the southern coast, the Sundarbans, an enormous mangrove forest
      shared with Eastern India, is home to the royal Bengal tiger.
